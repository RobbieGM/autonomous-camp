# autonomous-camp

A project containing the program I made for the Bentley Robo-Raptors' robot at Kettering University during a summer camp. The robot was typically able to, when using sensors, get to within 2 inches of accuracy distance-wise and 1 degree of accuracy angle-wise. The camp had a competition for the robots to see who could get the most points in different ways (e.g., scoring a ball into a hole) and this program won with a score of more than double the score of the second place winner.
